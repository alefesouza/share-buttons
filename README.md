# Share Buttons

Share Buttons is an Android application launched by me on October 22, 2014, four months after I started to search how to make Android apps by myself, learning Java just searching on internet.

The basic functionality of it is to share some URL on the device and open a page with the social network buttons, so you can like on Facebook or Google +1 (at this time it had a counter) any link.

You can download it on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.aloogle.sharebuttons).

Since I was starting to learn back-end/PHP at this time (my first contact with PHP was September 2014), I've hosted the buttons.html page on Tumblr with a super strange JavaScript on it, so the application would access it on a WebView passing the URL from Android share text function.
